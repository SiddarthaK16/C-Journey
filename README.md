# ðŸš€C-Journey
Showcasing my journey with C programming â€” starting from basic codes and logic, and building up from there.


##  Whatâ€™s in here?

A bunch of beginner-friendly C programs to learn and practice:
- 'ASCII_values.c' â€” classic starter
- `leap_year.c â€” logic practice
- `pass_checker.c' â€” using switch-case
- More coming as I learn!

##  Why this repo?

This is my personal learning log â€” uploading what I learn to track my progress, help others starting out, and build a clean portfolio.
